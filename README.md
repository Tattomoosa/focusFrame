# FocusFrame

This is a javascript library which helps you lay out very responsive images.

# Standard Usage

```javascript
let img = new FocusFrame ({
	center: [0,0],
	offset: [0,0],
	filter: 'none',
	imagePath: './images/image',
	repeat: [false, false],

	})
```

or whatever. The current version was hacked together in about 2 hours so I really wouldn't use it yet.
